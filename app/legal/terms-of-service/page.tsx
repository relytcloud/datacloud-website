                  For service fee settlements that adopt a prepaid model, you
                  are required to precharge and pay per usage. This means you
                  need to recharge your balance in advance into the account
                  associated with the DATACLOUD product you have registered (by
                  transferring funds to a bank account designated by DATA
                  CLOUD). The account balance must meet a certain amount (for
                  example, 500 yuan, but the actual amount is subject to the
                  specific product description) before you can start creating
                  and using product services. The balance can be obtained
                  through various means (for example: recharging, vouchers,
                  etc.). The service of DATACLOUD products generates a usage
                  bill for your actual usage on an hourly basis, measured in
                  natural hours (starting from the whole hour in UTC), and then
                  deducts it from your account balance.
                  <div className="pt-6">
                    You need to ensure in a timely manner that the account
                    balance for your DATACLOUD product is sufficient to pay for
                    the usage bills generated hourly in the past. If the account
                    balance is insufficient or the remaining balance falls below
                    a certain value, DATACLOUD will send you a reminder to
                    recharge your account balance (via email, SMS, or in-console
                    messages, etc.). If the account balance is insufficient,
                    DATACLOUD will provide your account with a certain duration
                    of credit period (for example, you can continue to use the
                    services normally within 24 hours after the corresponding
                    billing hour when the deduction was unsuccessful; the
                    specific credit period is subject to the actual notice you
                    receive from DATACLOUD). You should recharge your account
                    balance promptly to avoid service disruptions.

                    If, after entering the credit stage, there continue to be
                    several billing cycles of insufficient balance lasting
                    several hours, this will trigger certain actions by the DATA
                    CLOUD product on the service units within the product
                    (including freezing, reclaiming, deletion, etc. For specific

                    DATACLOUD typically generates the bill for the previous
                    natural hour during the next natural hour period. However,
                    it does not rule out the possibility of billing delays due
                    to force majeure reasons such as network issues or basic
                    cloud services. DATACLOUD will compensate for the delayed
                    bills in a subsequent natural hour billing cycle. After the
                    bill is generated, the account balance will then be

                  account or the previously specified bill-receiving email
                  address, among other methods. DATACLOUD will provide you with

                  within the aforementioned period, it will be considered that

                  parties shall conduct a verification, and the bill confirmed
                  by both parties after verification shall prevail. During the
                  verification period, you should first pay the undisputed

                  results but do not have conclusive evidence to prove an error

                  sales discounts, sales returns, or other situations requiring
                  the issuance of a new invoice or a credit note (red invoice)

                  (red invoice). This will be executed according to the
                  following policy:

                      deductions, you can simply return the invoice.

                    <li>
                      If you have already conducted tax certification deductions
                      for that invoice, or if the time for returning the invoice
                      has exceeded the month of issuance, you should provide
                      DATACLOUD with the necessary information for the issuance
                      of a credit note (red invoice), such as the &quot;VAT

                      If DATACLOUD has not yet issued the invoice or has issued
                      the invoice but has not yet delivered it to you, there is
                      no need for you to provide any invoice-related
                      information. After completing the above operations, you
                      may apply for the re-issuance of an invoice based on the
                      actual payment (payable) amount to DATACLOUD, and both
                      parties shall handle the corresponding refund. If the
                      conditions above are not met, re-issuance of invoices and

                  When your account in DATACLOUD products has no resource
                  occupation or consumption and all billing items have been
                  settled, you may apply for a refund of the balance in your
                  account for DATACLOUD products. Each time you add funds to
                  your DATACLOUD product account, a transaction record is
                  generated. Refund requests must be associated with specific
                  transaction records. When deductions are made from your
                  account balance, these are applied to the balances of
                  individual transaction records. Deductions are processed in
                  chronological order, starting with the earliest transaction.
                  During promotional activities, such as receiving a USD 50
                  bonus on a USD 100 recharge—effectively increasing your
                  account balance by USD 150—deductions will first apply to the
                  actual recharged amount in the transaction. Once the recharged
                  amount is fully deducted, the bonus balance will then be used.
                  It&quot;s important to note that bonus balances are not
                  eligible for refunds or withdrawals and will be cleared when a
                  refund for the associated transaction is issued. Upon
                  receiving a refund request, DATACLOUD will refund the actual
                  balance of the specified recharge record to your bank account
                  through the original payment method within 5 business days.
